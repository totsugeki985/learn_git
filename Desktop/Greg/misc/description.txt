I received my position from the College of Sciences Undergraduate Research Program. I worked on the third version of DisPredict: A Predictor of Disordered Protein. I was responsible for protein feature selection, which would then be input into the predictor. The feature selection was done using a Genetic Algorithm, implemented in Java, which was coupled with a Python script that utilized the SKLearn machine learning library to calculate genetic fitness. My responsibilities also included giving weekly presentations on my progress to my supervising professor.
